# neurodesk-on-arm
This projectâ€™s main goal is to test and run the [NeuroDesk](https://neurodesk.org) suite of medical imaging containers on ARM. For the purpose of testing, [Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs)](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) was chosen. ANTs computes high-dimensional mappings to capture the statistics of brain structure and function.

## Compiling ANTs natively on ARM

In order to compile ANTs natively on ARM, create a new ARM Ampere instance.

[Source:](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS)

```bash
workingDir=${PWD}
git clone https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs.git
mkdir build install
cd build
cmake \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${workingDir}/install \
    ../ANTs 2>&1 | tee cmake.log
make -j 4 2>&1 | tee build.log
cd ANTS-build
make install 2>&1 | tee install.log
```
