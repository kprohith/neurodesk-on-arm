# neurodesk-on-arm
This projectâ€™s main goal is to test and run the [NeuroDesk](https://neurodesk.org) suite of medical imaging containers on ARM. For the purpose of testing, Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) was chosen. ANTs computes high-dimensional mappings to capture the statistics of brain structure and function.
